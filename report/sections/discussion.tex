\section{Discussion}

These results underscore the need for adaptive exploration strategies in dynamic environments. Future work should implement adaptive epsilon functionality as a configurable option, allowing users to observe the benefits of exploration adjustment in response to environmental changes or performance degradation.

Additional enhancements could include more complex level designs featuring turns, branching paths, or multi-objective scenarios that would further emphasize the exploration-exploitation balance. Real-time plotting capabilities would also enhance the educational value by enabling direct comparison of different hyperparameter configurations during training, providing immediate visual feedback on parameter sensitivity and learning dynamics.
