\begin{abstract}
Reinforcement learning education faces significant challenges as students struggle to understand abstract concepts like exploration-exploitation trade-offs through mathematical formulations alone. Traditional approaches require complex programming environments and non-real-time training, obscuring fundamental principles. This paper presents a browser-based Q-learning environment enabling real-time visualization of learning behavior with simplified parameter control.

The system implements a navigation task where an agent learns to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles, using tabular Q-learning with user-controllable learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate, and reward structure. The web interface provides immediate observation of learning dynamics without programming requirements, featuring real-time monitoring, dynamic obstacle toggling, and data export capabilities.

The system successfully bridges theoretical reinforcement learning concepts with intuitive understanding through accessible visualization and parameter manipulation, validating the educational value of simplified, real-time learning environments.
